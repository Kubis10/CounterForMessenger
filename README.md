You can also check the number of messages for specific time intervals, so if you want to do a "messenger wrapped" this is the perfect app for that.

In messages folder you need to copy all folders from archived_threads, filtered_threads, e2ee_cutover and message_requests to inbox folder. Sometimes you will have 2 folders your_activity_across_facebook and your_facebook_activity so you need to copy from all places to one folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you downloaded from e2e messages inside the folder, which you indicate leter, create the "e2e" folder and paste the entire content of the "messages" directory

## Installation

## How to download messages

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Facebook has introduced E2EE (end-to-end encryption) to protect your conversations. End-to-end-encrypted conversation will have the e2ee part in the url, and default method will not be able to retrieve those conversations.

You can download a copy of all your end-to-end encrypted messages at any time if youâ€™ve turned on secure storage in Messenger by:

3. Click End-to-end encrypted chats.

6. Enter your PIN or use a one-time code to restore your chat history.
7. Click Download file and enter your Facebook password when prompted.
8. Click Download. It may take several minutes to prepare your download file (if you have many messages it can take up much longer).
